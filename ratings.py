# write a function that will accomplish these steps:
# create a file object by opening a file
# create an empty dictionary
# loop through each line of the file:
    # strip the line of white space on either side
    # split the line on spaces to create a list of words
    # save the key-value pairs into a dictionary, where the keys are the 
        # restaurant names, and the values are the ratings
# loop through the items in the dictionary:
    # print a formatted string (fstring) for each item
